# An Aesthetic's Artistry - 2
COLOUR (also spelled as Color depending on how you follow): is something that is a visual perception which brings joy into our monotonous life of grey scale. 

Colours are stimulative which means they can calm our nerves or rage our feelings. So an incorrect colour in a beautiful sketch has the power to destroy our appreciation while a random art with appealing colours can stir our emotions. Colours have the power to bring joy, anger, calmness, euphoria into our life. Every colour depicts something from our universe like how blue means sky and sea while green means nature. Colours have become every artist's tool to bring his/her art to life. 

So colour your way into the world!   ðŸŽ¨ðŸŽ¨

Here's some colour from my side. :)

P.S: so sorry if I have spoiled the art ðŸ˜… . It is my first attempt at shading with pencils. Next sketchings will be better than this. 

Tried to replicate from Art Arena
