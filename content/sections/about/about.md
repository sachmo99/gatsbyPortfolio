Hey, there! I am Sai Chandra Mouli Tadiparthi, hailing from a beautiful coastal town called Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh, India.

I am a Software Engineer with a passion for application development and Information Security.
I love to develop new applications and play a lot of CTFs(Capture The Flag contests) and am always vigilant and willing to learn new concepts, security vulnerabilities and patches.
